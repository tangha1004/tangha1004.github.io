<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm Ha, a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science at VNU, University of Engineering and Technology (2025). This website is where I share what I'm learning and exploring, mainly in statistics, algorithms and combinatorics, other computer science topics and occasionally some personal experiences.
