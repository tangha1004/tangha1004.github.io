# Answer 1
There is such a thing as too much reading. After a point, your brain will switch from active mode, where it's constantly trying to make connections between the ideas in the paper and your research problems, to passive mode, where you read the text, and understand the text, but your brain is too tired to do anything more. This is not only annoying (why am I unable to come up with anything new? Am I just not creative enough?), but also dangerous - your brain subconsciously starts believing that the paper you are reading has already solved the problem perfectly. In general, resist the urge to put in your '8 hours a day' - you are a scientist, not a factory worker (not that I disrespect factory workers). Try to keep your mind in a relaxed state as much as possible and research ideas will come to you automatically.

... and when those ideas hit you, be prepared to note them down. This may sound obvious, but I cannot stress the importance of this enough. Do this not only to offload your (often partial) ideas, but also so that you can revisit your notes later. When your relaxed mind (see paragraph above) reads all the ideas together, it starts making connections and finding common patterns between them - thus leading to more research ideas.

Finally, you may have noticed that focusing too hard on one research area (something all researchers do) often hampers the ability to think outside the box. The best way to overcome this is to simply read papers and attend research talks that are only slightly related (or unrelated) to your main research area. For example, if you are researching programming languages, try attending a computer architecture talk.

I think one of the most challenging parts of a doctoral program is picking a feasible, interesting and completable PhD Research Topic. All too often PhD students get through coursework (if their program requires it) and comprehensive exams and may fail to advance with identifying a topic for their doctoral research, or if a topic is chosen not see the degree through to completion.

Here are a few key suggestions for how to select a PhD research topic (of course the exact process will vary by one’s discipline, university, advisors, geographic location and one’s particular areas of interest/skills).

- **Use your coursework to develop and test out research ideas**: if one has coursework to complete before advancing to the research stage, using coursework to explore research ideas, conduct literature reviews, test out methodologies is invaluable. Ideally by the time one completes coursework you might have parts of your dissertation developed, particularly the proposal, perhaps the literature review and a good start to your methodology.
- **Experiment and write, explore, write, vision**: one of the challenges I ran into while in my doctoral program is I had a wide range of interests and had a hard time picking a single area to focus my research and writing. One approach I found very helpful was to write out my ideas in short paragraphs and/or do visual drawings of what a particular research endeavor might involve. Getting ideas from your head to pen and paper (or keyboard) helps tremendously.
- **Pick something feasible**: Too many people try to make their PhD their life’s work. For almost all people, the doctoral degree is a step in a (hopefully long) career of research or practice. Instead of feeling pressure to pick something that will change the world (not that this is a bad idea), find something that is actually doable within a reasonable amount of time.
- **Leverage the power of your committee**: If you a good job of selecting your doctoral advisors and committee, the members will hopefully be useful guides to narrowing down potential topics. They can help you (in my case they were great) helping you think about gaps in the field worth exploring, improving one’s methodology, and developing a doable research project. Of course it is also possible to have a committee that makes your academic life a miserable experience.
- **Your Peers**: In my own case, while faculty were helpful, I found intensive work with peers to be even more valuable. Some colleagues and I setup support groups where we met monthly and shared/suppored each other with our work. This was essential in making progress, getting feedback on our respective ideas, learning from each other’s successes and challenges. Too many doctoral candidates fail to harness the power of their peers.
- **Read other dissertations**: One of the things I found helpful to demystify the research process was to read (or more likely skim) other completed dissertations. This helped me with getting ideas of what others did for their research in my field, insights on methodology, understanding a realistic scope of a literature review, etc.
- **Match the methods to the research**: Make sure the methodology you use matches the goals and structure of your research. If you need help improving your methodology do it early.
- **Come up with a Data Analysis Plan**: This should be part of one’s research methodology. But make sure that you understand the approach and any technological tools one will use to aid in the research. For example in my cases I did about 60 semi-structured interviews, along with a detailed review of archives and other literature. To aid with the analysis of my interviews I used a qualitative analysis program called ATLAS.ti: The Qualitative Data Analysis & Research Software (there are many others). It took me some time (a few weeks) to really learn how to use the software but as I dived into my research the program helped greatly in making sense of the data.
- **Start Presenting at Conferences**: In my opinion too many people wait till they have a done product to present at conferences. I presented at numerous conferences during my degree and even though my research wasn’t complete, it was an invaluable experience in moving ahead. Plus at one conference I was invited to submit a paper which was published based on my initial findings (before I had dived into deep analysis) which was a wonderful insight.
- **Keep the End Goal in Mind**: The goal of all the research is to finish, finish, finish. Yes helping the world, or one’s field is great, making a contribution to academia, but the best dissertation is a done dissertation (it doesn’t have to be perfect but good enough). I know not everyone will agree with this but in my opinion getting it done is key. Of course one wants to and should feel proud of the work.

Being a PhD student is a full-time job which spans over 4 years, so it isn’t as hard to generate “new ideas” as it may seem from the outside, particularly if you are in a field you actually care about and have some talent for.

If you think (consciously and unconsciously) about a problem you find interesting for over 10 hours a day over several years, have access to a virtual and physical library to find resources, have the freedom to devote yourself to that one problem, and have mentors and peers to brainstorm with, why would it be hard to come up with and implement a few original ideas?

Do you really believe that all the best ways to approach the problem you are working on have been explored? Do you see nothing you can improve? Do all existing systems and approaches look perfect to you? If so, then perhaps you lack the imagination and drive needed to do original research, or perhaps the problem you are trying to solve is not novel enough for a PhD, or that you simply do not know the field and the background well enough to do any original research.

Based on my own experience with research in academia for 4 years, and then in corporate R&D for over 6 years, I have always have had far more ideas than time to pursue all of them. Once I start to really understand a problem, several potential avenues for research and improvement tend to open up and reveal themselves, and the question then becomes about which one of the several proposed paths do I actually spend resources on to pursue and implement. The process of ranking different solutions and narrowing down which ones you want to implement and focus on can be a very involved process. You have finite resources, so you can’t do everything.

The lack of any starting ideas is not a problem I have had in my research career.

The easy, boring, narrow way. Go for the things other researchers, including your supervisor, say should be done. Usually they work at something which is either a new theory, or a new solution, anyway, a new research topic, and there are parts that have to be developed. You can choose such parts, open problems which are not solved yet not because they are hard, but because they appear in a recent research area. You will find some of them mentioned in the papers of those working in that field, but since they don't have the time to fill every detail, you can do it. Such parts can be developed without much challenge, but you can also have interesting good ideas to solve them. You will find many seniors who can give you hints or ideas and be your coauthors, helping you in your career.

The hard, challenging way. Go for things they say can't be done, and you love to do. There may be various reasons why some open problems are considered impossible to be solved. In physics there are often some impossibility theorems. But if you read carefully and understand, you will find that the impossibility is proven under some assumptions. Play with these assumptions, find ways to solve the problem by dropping one or two of them. You may either improve the impossibility theorem, or find possible solutions which were not expected because people were said they can't be done. Many times people say an open problem can't be solved in a theory, only because they have their own theories, and want to justify the importance of their own research. Usually they say that simply because they were told so by others, and added their own subjective reasons why can't be done.

In my research, which is theoretical physics (although my PhD is in geometry), I took the hard way. It made my life and career very difficult, but I have the freedom to do what I want. I did all my research independently, including during PhD, and I even had to change the supervisor, although I had publications and I finished the thesis. The thesis was about singularities in general relativity, which people say that they show general relativity has to be replaced with something else. I took the challenge to show that, although the standard methods lead to infinities at singularities, they can be described in terms of finite quantities only, which still make geometric and physical sense (link to my PhD thesis). Another thing many say is impossible is to reconcile in quantum mechanics the dynamics given by the Schrodinger equation, with the (apparent) wavefunction collapse, due to measurements. So I work on this too (link to my latest paper on this).

Perhaps a safe compromise is to go the easy way during PhD and postdoc, and gradually switch to the hard way, especially if you have tenure.

# Answer 5

How do I begin research in theoretical computer science?

Short Answers : Read. Papers, Journals, Magazines, Thesis, Books, etc. Watch conference videos.

Long Answer :

I have no idea about your background in NLP or Theoretical CS, but the common start point for any kind of research is reading. Most people generally have misconception that papers are too technical for them, but in reality they are not. Books, especially the curriculum books contain information that was about a decade old. Some traditional books are like 3 - 4 decades old. For getting more information about the current development in a particular field, one has to refer to papers.

Initially reading a paper might seem boring and tedious. You might now even understand half the thing. Half the people give up while reading their first paper itself. It took me a week to read my first paper (:P). But with time your pace will increase. Just keep reading and understanding. You can Google technical terms used in the paper or refer to wikipedia page, if any. Make sure you always refer to some authentic source for information.

If you have any specific area in mind like NLP, you can directly search for popular journals in that field and start reading at once. If you do not have anything specific in mind, try to explore and find one. I believe the best research can be carried out if you are inspired by a real-life problem. If you are completely blank try reading papers of different field and find something interesting. Force yourself to choose at-least some broad area. Eventually, you will find find your way.

For getting started you can browse through the following widely used Digital Libraries :
1. ACM Digital Library
2. IEEE Xplore Digital Library
3. Home - Springer
4. Search through over 11 million science, health, medical journal full text articles and books.
5. Page on researchgate.net (Networking Website)

You can also use Google Scholar for searching academic articles. You also need access rights to some of these libraries. Many Govt Colleges (at least IITs and NITs) provide free access to popular libraries via LAN/WiFi.

Once you find your first interesting paper, the references will take you to related papers and so on. Their will be a kind of chain reaction and you will slowly understand the ideas proposed by various researchers from across the globe. You can even try and email the authors in case you have any question regarding their work. If the question is legitimate, they will reply most of the time. You can take help from your college professors too. And Google is always there for help.

After papers, you can move on to Journals and Magazines related to the specific field. Magazines also give you an idea about the current industrial demand, new trends and emerging techniques. This will help you classify work according to their need in the current scenario. After all, necessity is the mother of all inventions :). Thesis are generally very specific and contains an in-depth analysis of a particular topic.

After getting a broad idea about the current on-going research in an area, you will start having your own arguments and explanations. One good thing about Theoretical CS research is that there is nothing wrong or right. It's all about arguments, testing and finally determining the "better" way. You can try and implement the idea proposed in a paper and evaluate the results obtained. You can also hybridize two or more independent work to see if you can improve the existing method. You may even propose a completely new idea that you think will be relevant to the context. Trust me, once you start reading a lot about a field, you start getting new ideas automatically. Sometimes to immediately relate o work done in different context to the current context.

Slowly things will build up and you will have enough material to write your own paper and that will just be the beginning. Test you proposal, analyze the result and then show off your work to the world.

I also think that group work is quite helpful in research because as I said nothing is wrong or right, so multiple opinions about a topic is of utmost importance.

Also, Documentation is very very important. I have learned a lot just by roughly documenting whatever I read or find out. Keep a small diary or use sticky notes or use gedit.

About the Projects : I think starting a project straight-away is not at all a good idea if you want to get into core research. For taking up good research project you must have some knowledge about the current work. Even if you are doing a project, make sure it is unique and original. You can try and implement various algorithms/mechanisms proposed by other people. Make sure your project contributes significantly to the field. Don't just code something that will never be seen again by anyone else after you stop working.

If you badly want to work on a project, I suggest you should try working on a bigger open-source project related to the field - you will learn much more.
